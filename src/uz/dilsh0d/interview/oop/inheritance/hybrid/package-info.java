 * Hybrid Inheritance in Java:
 * Hybrid Inheritance in Java is a combination of Inheritances.
 * In this type of Inheritance, more than one kind of inheritance is observed.
 * For example, if we have class A and class B that extend class C and then
 * there is another class D that extends class A,
 * then this type of Inheritance is known as Hybrid Inheritance.
 *
 * Why? Because we clearly observe that there is two kinds
 * of inheritance here- Hierarchical and Single Inheritance.
