 *
 * Multiple Inheritance in Java:
 * Defining derived class from numerous base classes is known as ‘Multiple Inheritance’.
 * In this case, there is more than one superclass, and there can be one or more subclasses.
 *
 * Multiple inheritances are available in object-oriented programming with C++,
 * but it is not available in Java.
 *
 * Java developers want to use multiple inheritances in some cases. Fortunately,
 * Java developers have interface concepts expecting the developers to achieve
 * multiple inheritances by using multiple interfaces.
